## Developer Information

### Husky Pre-Commit Hooks

We have Husky set up to enforce pre-commit checks. These checks ensure that code is properly formatted and linted before being committed.

- **Linting and Formatting**: We use ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. These tools help maintain code quality and consistency across the project.
- **Lint-Staged**: This tool runs linters on only staged files, ensuring quick feedback and preventing bad code from being committed.

### Lint and Prettier

We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce code quality and style guidelines.

- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality by catching syntax errors and enforcing best practices.
- **Prettier**: Formats code consistently to improve readability.

### Commitlint

We use [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce conventional commit messages. This ensures that our commit history is readable and that semantic versioning can be applied.
